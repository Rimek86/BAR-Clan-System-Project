# BAR-Clan-System-Project

This repository is a meta-repository designed to plan and specify all aspects of a clan system for the game Beyond All Reason.

This README.md serves as the entry point and main navigation for this project. The following table of contents outlines everything you can find in this repository:

## Scope of this Project

### Overall Introduction

The clan system is primarily intended to encourage the formation of permanent groups that play BAR together. Unlike a party, however, this group should be persistent and ideally remain together in the lobby when creating a match (this is still just a rough idea, and feasibility is not yet clear!). Additionally, clan membership should be visible in the game, and the clan itself should be able to use its own clan profile to promote itself and potentially link to external information sources.

### Basis for a Tournament System

The topics mentioned above are essentially comfort features. The actual purpose and added value of the clan system is to establish the foundation for a comprehensive tournament system, where clans can register for tournaments, clan leaders are automatically designated as points of contact, and clans can be listed in one or more leaderboards to further promote the fun of tournaments and strengthen the community.

### Further possible development goals

For a future implementation, it would also be possible to establish a messaging system for clans. This would allow all clan leaders and co-leaders to have access to a shared inbox to review clan applications (potentially even with an application form) or to send and receive official messages for the clan regarding tournaments.
